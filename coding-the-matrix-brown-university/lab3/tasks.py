 Problem 2: Write and test a procedure scalevecs(vecdict) for the following:
 input:A dictionary vecdict mapping positive numbers to vectors(instances of Vec)
 output: a list of vectors, one foreach item in vecdict. If vecdict contains a keyk mapping to a
 vector v, the output should contain the vector(1/k)v
